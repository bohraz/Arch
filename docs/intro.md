## What is Arch?

Arch is a sophisticated open-source hierarchical state machine library for Roblox, inspired by the [SCXML specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/). A state machine is a conceptual model that organizes the behavior of a system into distinct states, transitions, and actions. It's like a roadmap for your program, guiding it through different scenarios based on events or conditions. Arch adopts this idea and tailors it to Roblox projects, providing an organized and efficient way to manage the various states various game systems can be in.

## Why Use Arch?
Arch simplifies the complexities of state management, offering a versatile toolkit that benefits a variety of scenarios. Whether you're crafting combat systems, dynamic interfaces, or intricate artificial intelligence, Arch empowers developers by:  
  
* Enhancing Logic Control: Navigate through diverse project states with precision, ensuring a seamless and immersive user experience.  
  
* Improving Code Clarity: Streamline your codebase with efficient state transitions, contributing to better organization and maintainability.  
  
* Optimizing Conflict Resolution: Benefit from Arch's conflict resolution mechanisms, providing a robust solution for handling complex scenarios.
